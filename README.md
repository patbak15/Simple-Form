642 HCI Form Assignment

This report was to practice creating readable and user friendly forms. This assignment was to test our ability in creating a simple form that has to take user’s input and validate each of the fields. In this report I will cover the steps I took into developing this form and what tools and processes I used to make sure that each of the forms fields were properly validated. Since the class went through many ‘exploratory’ options creating forms was an assignment that could be used for our portfolio for software engineering skills. By creating a form, we focus on making the form readable and following user centered design practices allowing the user to easily fill out the required information. Many users fill out forms on an everyday basis (e.g. registration forms) so creating a form from scratch shows that we are focusing on making an interface that people are able to understand and not get frustrated over inputting information.
